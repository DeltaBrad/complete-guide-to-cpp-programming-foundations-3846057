int main(){

    celsius = (static_cast<float>(5) / 9.0) * (fahrenheit - 32); //5 has been converted from int to float, 9 has been converted from int to double, compiler will use largest type to perform math operation.
    //celsius = (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32); This would have a value of 0, since compiler would treat 5/9 as int/int, which would return the quotient of 0, then 0*X is 0.

    std::cout << "Fractional part: " << (int)((weight - int(weight))*10000) << std::endl; //this would show the decimal portion as a whole integer to 4 decimal places
